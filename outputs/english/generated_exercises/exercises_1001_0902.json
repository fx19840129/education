  "prompt_used": "You are an English teaching expert who needs to generate practice exercises based on daily learned vocabulary, morphology, and syntax.\n\nLearning Stage: Stage 1: Basic Consolidation (Upper Elementary Grades)\n\nToday's Learning Content:\n1. Word List:\n   - kg (noun)\n   - river (noun)\n   - honey (noun)\n   - brother (noun)\n   - pal (noun)\n   - hurry (verb)\n   - fall (noun/verb)\n   - o'clock (noun/adverb)\n   - go to school (phrase)\n   - go swimming (phrase)\n\n2. Morphology Items:\n   - Third Person Singular - Present Simple: When the subject is third person singular (he, she, it, or singular nouns), the present tense verb form changes.\n     Rules: Generally add -s (plays, eats, likes); for words ending with -s, -x, -ch, -sh, add -es (watches, goes)\n   - Adverb: Modifies verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.\n     Rules: Learn common adverbs (e.g., very, quickly - basic); many adverbs are formed by adding -ly to adjectives.\n\n3. Syntax Structures:\n   - Where is...?: Where is...? - Wh-Question - Used to ask about the location of something.\n     Example: Where is the book?\n   - Subject-Verb-Indirect Object-Direct Object: Subject-Verb-Indirect Object-Direct Object - A structure where a verb is followed by two objects.\n     Example: He gave me a pen.\n\nPlease generate practice exercises based on the above learning content, with the following requirements:\n1.
